# Simple HTML Table with Pseudo-Class Selectors

A small front-end project that displays order data using a semantic HTML table and basic CSS styling.

This project focuses on proper table structure, clean styling, and improving readability using simple CSS selectors without any frameworks.

## Purpose

This project was built to:
* Practice semantic HTML table elements
* Reinforce basic CSS table styling
* Improve readability using simple layout and spacing techniques

## Features
Displays order data by country and uses semantic table sections:
* thead
* tbody
* tfoot
* Alternating row colors for better readability
* Styled header row for visual clarity

## Tech Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3

## How It Works
* The table data is structured using semantic HTML elements.
* CSS is used to control spacing, borders, and alignment.
* The nth-child pseudo-class applies alternating background colors to table rows.
* A footer row displays the total order amount.

## Styling Notes
* border-collapse is used to keep the table clean and compact
* Padding improves readability across table cells
* Alternating row colors make it easier to scan data quickly

## Demo
Open the HTML file in your browser (live server) to view the table.  
No setup or build steps required.
